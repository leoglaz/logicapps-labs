## Adding Domain specific knowledge to an Agent

Adding domain-specific knowledge to an AI agent significantly enhances its ability to deliver accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses. By incorporating specialized information, the agent can better understand industry terminology, workflows, and unique challenges, resulting in more effective problem-solving and decision-making. This targeted expertise enables the agent to provide tailored recommendations, automate complex tasks, and improve user trust by demonstrating a deeper understanding of the domain. Ultimately, domain-specific knowledge transforms a generic AI agent into a valuable resource that drives greater efficiency and business value within its intended environment.

Azure Logic Apps provides a comprehensive suite of document processing and transformation actions that enable seamless data ingestion from diverse sources and document formats.
